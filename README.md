Nearest Flight API

The Nearest Flight API demonstrates how location-based targeting can power online display advertisement, enabling one ad unit to serve personalised flight offers across multiple markets. This avoids the costly production of separate creatives for each region, currency, or campaign window.

It works by detecting a userâ€™s location with **IP2Location**, finding the **nearest airport in the same country**, and returning a flight from a local pricing map. If the userâ€™s country has no matching airports or no price available, the API responds with `flight: null` and a clear error message.

In a production scenario, youâ€™d replace the sample data with live fares from an airlineâ€™s API or a public service like [Sky-Scrapper on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/apiheya/api/sky-scrapper).  
For this demo, a static `flights.json` file is included to keep everything self-contained and easy to test.
